Recap the objectives of this part of the experience (a short paragraph is enough)
Students should provide a description of the overall experimental setup. It is recommended that you include
simple schematic drawings of the setup, optionally together with photos. For drawing the setup, this is a
useful open-source library of SVG images: https://www.gwoptics.org/ComponentLibrary/
