In this experiment, we investigate the interaction between coherent light and matter using the D1 transition line of Cesium-133 ($6^2S_{1/2} \rightarrow 6^2P_{1/2}$) at approximately \SI{894}{\nano\meter}. The primary objectives are to characterize the emission properties of a Distributed Bragg Reflector (DBR) laser diode and to perform high-resolution spectroscopy on Cesium vapor.

We employ absorption spectroscopy to observe the Doppler-broadened atomic transitions and Saturated Absorption Spectroscopy (SAS) to resolve the hyperfine structure obscured by the Doppler width. Furthermore, we calibrate the laser frequency scan using a Michelson interferometer and calculate the atomic density of the vapor, comparing it with theoretical predictions based on the ideal gas law and vapor pressure curves, assuming thermal equilibrium and ideal gas behavior.
